		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">
			A ray that emits from an origin in a certain direction. This is used by the
			[page:RayCaster] to assist with [link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting raycasting].
			Raycasting is used for mouse picking (working out what objects in the 3D space the mouse is over) amongst
			other things.
