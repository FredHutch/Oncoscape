		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">
		<p>
		This class is an efficient alternative to [page:Geometry], because it stores all data, including
		vertex positions, face indices, normals, colors, UVs, and custom attributes within buffers; this
		reduces the cost of passing all this data to the GPU.<br />
		This also makes BufferGeometry harder to work with than [page:Geometry]; rather than accessing
		position data as [page:Vector3] objects, color data as [page:Color] objects, and so on, you have to
		access the raw data from the appropriate [page:BufferAttribute attribute buffer]. This makes
		BufferGeometry best-suited for static objects where you don't need to manipulate the geometry much
		after instantiating it.
		</p>

		<h2>Example</h2>
		<code>
		var geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
		// create a simple square shape. We duplicate the top left and bottom right
		// vertices because each vertex needs to appear once per triangle.
		var vertices = new Float32Array( [
			-1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
			 1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
			 1.0,  1.0,  1.0,

			 1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
			-1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
			-1.0, -1.0,  1.0
		] );

		// itemSize = 3 because there are 3 values (components) per vertex
		geometry.addAttribute( 'position', new THREE.BufferAttribute( vertices, 3 ) );
		var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xff0000 } );
		var mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );

		<h2>Accessing Attributes</h2>
		<p>
		WebGL stores data associated with individual vertices of a geometry in <em>attributes</em>.
		Examples include the position of the vertex, the normal vector for the vertex, the vertex color,
		and so on. When using [page:Geometry], the [page:WebGLRenderer renderer] takes care of wrapping
		up this information into typed array buffers and sending this data to the shader. With
		BufferGeometry, all of this data is stored in buffers associated with individual attributes.
		This means that to get the position data associated with a vertex (for instance), you must call
		[page:.getAttribute] to access the 'position' [page:BufferAttribute attribute], then access the individual
		x, y, and z coordinates of the position.
		</p>
		<p>
		The following attributes are set by various members of this class:
		</p>
		<h3>[page:BufferAttribute position] (itemSize: 3)</h3>
		<div>
		Stores the x, y, and z coordinates of each vertex in this geometry. Set by [page:.fromGeometry]().
		</div>

		<h3>[page:BufferAttribute normal] (itemSize: 3)</h3>
		<div>
		Stores the x, y, and z components of the face or vertex normal vector of each vertex in this geometry.
		Set by [page:.fromGeometry]().
		</div>

		<h3>[page:BufferAttribute color] (itemSize: 3)</h3>
		<div>
		Stores the red, green, and blue channels of vertex color of each vertex in this geometry.
		Set by [page:.fromGeometry]().
		</div>

		<h3>[page:BufferAttribute index] (itemSize: 1)</h3>
		Allows for vertices to be re-used across multiple triangles; this is called using "indexed triangles" and
		works much the same as it does in [page:Geometry]: each triangle is associated with the indices of three vertices.
		This attribute therefore stores the index of each vertex for each triangular face.

		If this attribute is not set, the [page:WebGLRenderer renderer] assumes that each three contiguous
		positions represent a single triangle.
		</div>
		<p>
		In addition to the the built-in attributes, you can set your own custom attributes using the addAttribute method. With [page:Geometry], these attributes are set and stored on the [page:Material]. In BufferGeometry, the attributes are stored with the geometry itself. Note that you still need to set the attributes information on the material as well, but the value of each attribute is stored in the BufferGeometry.
		</p>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<div>
		This creates a new [name]. It also sets several properties to a default value.
		</div>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Hashmap attributes]</h3>
		<div>
		This hashmap has as id the name of the attribute to be set and as value the [page:BufferAttribute buffer] to set it to.
		Rather than accessing this property directly, use addAttribute and getAttribute to access attributes of this geometry.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Box3 boundingBox]</h3>
		<div>
			Bounding box for the bufferGeometry, which can be calculated with
			[page:.computeBoundingBox](). Default is *null*.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Sphere boundingSphere]</h3>
		<div>
			Bounding sphere for the bufferGeometry, which can be calculated with
			[page:.computeBoundingSphere](). Default is *null*.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Object drawRange]</h3>
		<div>
			Used to determine what part of the geometry should be rendered. This should not
			be set directly, instead use [page:.setDrawRange].<br />
			Default is
			<code>
				{ start: 0, count: Infinity }
			</code>
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Array groups]</h3>
		<div>
			Split the geometry into groups, each of which will be rendered in a separate WebGL draw call.
			This allows a [page:MultiMaterial] to be used with the bufferGeometry.<br /><br />

			Each group is an object of the form:
			<code>{ start: Integer, count: Integer, materialIndex: Integer }</code>
			where start specifies the index of the first vertex in this draw call, count specifies
			how many vertices are included, and materialIndex specifies the [page:MultiMaterial] index to use.<br /><br />

			Use [page:.addGroup] to add groups, rather than modifying this array directly.
		</div>


		<!-- Note: groups used to be called drawCalls

		<h3>[property:Array drawcalls]</h3>
		<div>
		For geometries that use indexed triangles, this Array can be used to split the object
		into multiple WebGL draw calls. Each draw call will draw some subset of the vertices
		in this geometry using the configured [page:Material shader]. This may be necessary if,
		for instance, you have more than 65535 vertices in your object.
		</div> -->


		<h3>[property:Integer id]</h3>
		<div>Unique number for this bufferGeometry instance.</div>

		<h3>[property:BufferAttribute index]</h3>
		<div>
			See "Accessing Attributes" section above for a description of this property.
			Default is *null*.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isBufferGeometry]</h3>
		<div>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are BufferGeometries. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Integer MaxIndex]</h3>
		<div>Maximum number of vertices allowed, set to *65535*.</div>

		<h3>[property:Object morphAttributes]</h3>
		<div>
			Hashmap of [page:BufferAttribute]s holding details of the geometry's [page:Geometry.morphTargets morphTargets].
		</div>

		<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
		<div>
		Optional name for this bufferGeometry instance. Default is an empty string.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
		<div>
		[link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier UUID] of this object instance.
		This gets automatically assigned and shouldn't be edited.
		</div>
