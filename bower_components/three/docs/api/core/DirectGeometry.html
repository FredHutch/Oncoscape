		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[page:EventDispatcher EventDispatcher] methods are available on this class.</h3>

		<h3>[property:null computeBoundingBox](  )</h3>
		<div>
		 See [page:Geometry.computeBoundingBox].
		</div>

		<h3>[property:null computeBoundingSphere](  )</h3>
		<div>
		 See [page:Geometry.computeBoundingSphere].
		</div>

		<h3>[property:null computeGroups]( [page:Geometry geometry] )</h3>
		<div>
			Compute the parts of the geometry that have different materialIndex.
			See [page:BufferGeometry.groups].
		</div>

		<h3>[method:null dispose]()</h3>
		<div>
		Disposes the object from memory. <br />
		You need to call this when you want the directGeometry removed while the application is running.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:null fromGeometry]( [page:Geometry geometry] )</h3>
		<div>Pass in a [page:Geometry] instance for conversion.</div>
