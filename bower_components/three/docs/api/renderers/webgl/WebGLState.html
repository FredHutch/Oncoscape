		<h3>[method:null setDepthTest]( [page:boolean depthTest] )</h3>
		<div>
		depthTest -- The boolean to decide if depth of a fragment needs to be tested against the depth buffer . <br />
		</div>
		<div>
		This sets, based on depthTest, whether or not the depth data needs to be tested against the depth buffer.
		</div>

		<h3>[method:null setDepthWrite]( [page:boolean depthWrite] )</h3>
		<div>
		depthWrite -- The boolean to decide if depth of a fragment needs to be kept. <br />
		</div>
		<div>
		This sets, based on depthWrite, whether or not the depth data needs to be written in the depth buffer.
		</div>

		<h3>[method:null setBlending]( [page:number blending], [page:number blendEquation], [page:number blendSrc], [page:number blendDst] )</h3>
		<div>
		blending -- A number indicating the blending mode. Possible value are THREE.NoBlending, THREE.NormalBlending, THREE.AdditiveBlending, THREE.SubtractiveBlending, THREE.MultiplyBlending or THREE.CustomBlending <br />
		blendEquation -- When blending is THREE.CustomBlending, then you can set the blendEquation. Possible values are THREE.AddEquation, THREE.SubtractEquation or THREE.ReverseSubtractEquation.<br />
		blendSrc -- When blending is THREE.CustomBlending, then you can set the blendSrc. Possible values are THREE.ZeroFactor, THREE.OneFactor,THREE.SrcColorFactor, THREE.OneMinusSrcColorFactor, THREE.SrcAlphaFactor, THREE.OneMinusSrcAlphaFactor, THREE.DstAlphaFactor, THREE.OneMinusDstAlphaFactor, THREE.DstColorFactor,THREE.OneMinusDstColorFactor or THREE.SrcAlphaSaturateFactor<br />
		blendDst -- When blending is THREE.CustomBlending, then you can set the blendDst. Possible values are THREE.ZeroFactor, THREE.OneFactor,THREE.SrcColorFactor, THREE.OneMinusSrcColorFactor, THREE.SrcAlphaFactor, THREE.OneMinusSrcAlphaFactor, THREE.DstAlphaFactor, THREE.OneMinusDstAlphaFactor, THREE.DstColorFactor,THREE.OneMinusDstColorFactor or THREE.SrcAlphaSaturateFactor
		</div>
		<div>
		This method sets the correct blending.
