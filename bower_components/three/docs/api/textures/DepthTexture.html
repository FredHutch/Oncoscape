		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">
		Creates a texture for use as a Depth Texture. Require support for the
    <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/WEBGL_depth_texture/">WEBGL_depth_texture</a>
    extension. According to <a href="https://webglstats.com/">WebGLStats</a>, as of February 2016 around 85%
    of WebGL enabled devices support this.
    <br /><br />

    <h2>Example</h2>

    [example:webgl_depth_texture depth / texture]

		<h2>Constructor</h2>
		<h3>[name]( [page:Number width], [page:Number height], [page:Constant type], [page:Constant wrapS], [page:Constant wrapT], [page:Constant magFilter], [page:Constant minFilter], [page:Number anisotropy], [page:Constant format] )</h3>

    <div>
		[page:Number width] -- width of the texture.<br />

		[page:Number height] -- height of the texture.<br />

    [page:Constant type] -- Default is [page:Textures THREE.UnsignedShortType].
     See [page:Textures type constants] for other choices.<br />

    [page:Constant mapping] --
    See [page:Textures type constants] for details.<br />

    [page:Constant wrapS] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
		See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant wrapT] -- The default is [page:Textures THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping].
		See [page:Textures wrap mode constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant magFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel covers more than one pixel.
		The default is [page:Textures THREE.NearestFilter]. See [page:Textures magnification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

		[page:Constant minFilter] -- How the texture is sampled when a texel covers less than one pixel.
		 The default is [page:Textures THREE.NearestFilter]. See [page:Textures minification filter constants] for other choices.<br />

     [page:Number anisotropy] -- The number of samples taken along the axis through the pixel that has the highest density of texels.
     By default, this value is 1. A higher value gives a less blurry result than a basic mipmap, at the cost of more texture samples being used.
     Use [page:WebGLrenderer.getMaxAnisotropy renderer.getMaxAnisotropy]() to find the maximum valid anisotropy value for the GPU; this value is usually a power of 2.<br />

    [page:Constant format] -- must be either [page:Textures DepthFormat] (default) or [page:Textures DepthStencilFormat].
     See [page:Textures format constants] for details.<br />

		</div>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<div>
    See the base [page:Texture Texture] class for common properties
    - the following are also part of the texture class, but have different defaults here.
    </div>

		<h3>[page:Texture.format .format]</h3>
		<div>
    Either [page:Textures DepthFormat] (default) or [page:Textures DepthStencilFormat].
    See [page:Textures format constants] for details.<br />
		</div>

    <h3>[page:Texture.type .type]</h3>
    <div>
    Default is [page:Textures THREE.UnsignedShortType].
    See [page:Textures format constants] for details.<br />
    </div>

    <h3>[page:Texture.magFilter .magFilter]</h3>
    <div>
      How the texture is sampled when a texel covers more than one pixel.
  		The default is [page:Textures THREE.NearestFilter].
      See [page:Textures magnification filter constants] for other choices.
    </div>

    <h3>[page:Texture.minFilter .minFilter]</h3>
    <div>
    How the texture is sampled when a texel covers less than one pixel.
  	The default is [page:Textures THREE.NearestFilter].
    See [page:Textures magnification filter constants] for other choices.
    </div>

    <h3>[page:Texture.flipY .flipY]</h3>
    <div>
    Depth textures do not need to be flipped so this is *false* by default.
    </div>

    <h3>[page:Texture.generateMipmaps .generateMipmaps]</h3>
    <div>
    Depth textures do not use mipmaps.
    </div>
