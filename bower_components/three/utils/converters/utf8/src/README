Usage: ./objcompress in.obj [out.utf8]

        If 'out' is specified, then attempt to write out a compressed,
        UTF-8 version to 'out.'

        If not, write a JSON version to STDOUT.

        Perform vertex cache analysis on in.obj using specified sizes.
        For example: ./objanalyze in.obj 6 16 24 32
        Maximum cache size is 32.

Building:

Since there are no external dependences outside of the C/C++ standard
libraries, you can pretty much build this however you please. I've
included a cheeky way to do this on POSIX-like systems by including a
build shell script at the top of the file itself. You can build by
making the .cc file executable, and running it on the command line.
