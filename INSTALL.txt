Install
-------

These instructions describe how to install and run Oncoscape with the necessary data, 
analysis, and R dependency packages.  

	1. System Requirements
	2. Build From Source
	3. Runtime Configuration
	4. Deploy Web Application


1. System Requirements
----------------------

	- Install R from https://cran.r-project.org/
	
	- Create directory to store persistent information:
	  Replace <path/to/directory> with where you would like to store R metadata attached
	  to your login account.
	  
	  >nano ~/.bash_profile
	  
	  add the following line:
	  export ONCOSCAPE_USER_DATA_STORE=file:///<path/to/directory>

2. Build From Source
--------------------

--(optional) Local installation of R packages
To install and run Oncoscape locally, explicitly define the R path and directory of the
working library $R_LIBS.  One method is to create a bash configuration file defining the
necessary environment variables.  In this case we create a file called .setupR and 
prioritize /usr/bin/R as the R executable and Rlibs/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/3.2
as the R library.  Note that the full path should be used instead of referencing a <cwd>.
 	
 	>vi .setupR
		PATH=/usr/bin/R:$PATH
		export R_LIBS= <cwd>/Rlibs/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/3.2

 	>source .setupR
 	>which R
 	>echo $R_LIBS
 
 This file will need to be called from the terminal before any update, installation, or 
 execution to ensure the proper directory structure is accessed.

-- To install within the local $R_LIBS directory, call "localInstall" from the makefile.

	>make installLocal
	
-- To install within the default R library, call "globalInstall" from the makefile.

	>make install


2a. If using OSX, the following homebrew command will install the latest R in /usr/local/Cellar. 

brew install r

All of the required dependencies for R will be installed automatically. The contents of the .setupR file should look something like this (the contents below may need to be modified):

PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/r/3.2.2_1/R.framework/Resources:$PATH
export R_LIBS=/usr/local/Cellar/r/3.2.2_1/R.framework/Resources/library

Once the .setupR file is modified and sourced, the next step is to run "make installLocal".

3. Runtime Configuration
------------------------

-- Configuration files are saved within the Oncoscape module from which they run.
For example, see Oncoscape/inst/scripts/apps/oncoscape/runOncoscapeApp-7777.R
This first defines the app to run (scriptDir), user email for login (userID), datasets to load 
(current.datasets), and port to host (port), then launches Oncoscape within the browser.

	library(OncoDev14)
	scriptDir <- "apps/oncoscape"
	stopifnot(nchar(Sys.getenv("ONCOSCAPE_USER_DATA_STORE")) > 0)
	userID <- "test@nowhere.org"
	current.datasets <- c("DEMOdz")
	port <- 11005
	onco <- OncoDev14(port=port, scriptDir=scriptDir, userID=userID, datasetNames=current.datasets)
	if(Sys.info()[["nodename"]] != "lopez") 
	   browseURL(sprintf("http://localhost:%d", port))
	run(onco)


4. Deploy Web Application
-------------------------

-- To run a given configuration file and host the server, call the make command from that 
   local module directory.  Examples linking to these calls also exist within the master
   makefile at the oncoDev14 level.  
   
   >make oncoApp7777
   
   This calls oncoApp7777, kills the currently running server, changes directory to the 
   local modules, and runs the local make command to launch the process:
   
	(cd Oncoscape/inst/scripts/apps/oncoscape/; make local;)
