node-httpd
==========

I was sick of having to configure a web server every time I need to have some
directory served up via http. So I hacked together this little script. It is
based on connect's staticProvider with all the caching stuff hacked out and
more sophisticated index.html support. 

Installing
==========

    $ npm install httpd

Using
=====

    $ httpd.js

`node-httpd` will start serving the current working directory on http://localhost:3010.

Using a different port
----------------------

    $ httpd.js 8080

`node-httpd` will now serve on http://localhost:8080
