Oncoscape is a [web application](http://oncoscape.sttrcancer.org) that hosts an integrated suite of analysis tools for users to explore hypotheses related to molecular and clinical data in order to better understand cancer biology and treatment options.

--**_Intro and Demo and videos coming soon_**

Oncoscape is developed at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center under the auspices of the Solid Tumor Translational Research initiative. 		

Oncoscape is as an SPA -- a single page web application -- using JavaScript in the browser and R (primarily) on the backend server. It is an R package, though the immediate web-facing http server, currently written in R, will likely change over time to a more traditional architecture. For more detailed information, please see [wiki](https://github.com/FredHutch/Oncoscape/wiki).		

## The Goal <img src="https://github.com/FredHutch/Oncoscape/blob/newReadme/img/signature.png" width="40">

The ultimate goal is to connect the entire pipeline of cancer research, from molecular data and research experiments to clinical and patient data. By giving clinicians and researchers direct access to the data and methods through an online portal, more time is spent answering biological questions than formatting files and installing disparate software packages.

Oncoscape's design encourages custom deployments focused on any clinical/molecular data set. Oncoscape, here at GitHub, ships with patient and molecular data from the TCGA. 

If you would like to update the code or contribute with new features, please read [wiki contribution](https://github.com/FredHutch/Oncoscape/wiki/Contribution).
