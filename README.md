[Oncoscape](http://oncoscape.sttrcancer.org) A data visualization platform that empowers researchers to discover novel patterns and relationships between clinical and molecular data. Through a suite of interoperable tools, Oncoscape offers a unique and intuitive approach to hypothesis refinement. For more detailed information, please read [Oncoscape Documentation](http://oncoscape.sttrcancer.org/documentation/).

Oncoscape is developed at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center under the auspices of the Solid Tumor Translational Research initiative.  Read more about our team and mission on the [Oncoscape homepage](http://www.sttrcancer.org/en/biotools/oncoscape.html).

With the assistance of the general coding community, we hope to deliver polished tools that are easier for clinicians to use and that can grow and adapt indefinitely with emerging technologies. [See how your expertise can make an impact](https://github.com/FredHutch/Oncoscape/wiki/Contribution).

## The Goal [<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5760217/14293557/ef3ba88c-fb21-11e5-8f64-fff93ebebfa6.png" width="40">](https://github.com/FredHutch/Oncoscape/wiki)

The ultimate goal is to connect the entire pipeline of cancer research, from molecular data and research experiments to clinical and patient data. By giving clinicians and researchers direct access to the data and methods through an online portal, more time is spent answering biological questions than formatting files and installing disparate software packages.

Oncoscape's design encourages custom deployments focused on any clinical/molecular data set. Oncoscape, here at GitHub, ships with patient and molecular data from the TCGA.
