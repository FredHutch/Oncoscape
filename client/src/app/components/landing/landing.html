                <h2>Eric Holland, MD, PhD</h2>
                <p style="font-size:16px;">Director, Human Biology Division, Fred Hutch<br />

                </p>

                <p>Dr. Holland is a world-renowned physician-scientist who combines compassionate patient care with exacting laboratory research
                to discover more effective treatments for brain tumors. As a neurosurgeon, Dr. Holland specializes
                in caring for patients with glioblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumors in adults. He is
                committed to finding targeted treatment options for this aggressive cancer, which currently has few
                effective therapies. He continues to foster productive collaborations to spark discovery and advance
                precision oncology. He believes Oncoscape has the potential to transform patient treatment. Using
                this tool, researchers can now begin to group tumors by their genetic profiles to help physicians
                select therapies likely to work best for each patient.</p>

                <p style="font-size:16px;">Bioinformatics project manager, Seattle Tumor Translational Research, <nobr>Fred Hutch</nobr></p>

                <p>Dr. McFerrin specializes in the development of software and methods that bridge genomic and clinical data to advance the understanding of cancer biology and improve patient care. In her role as bioinformatics project manager within STTR, she designs tools that facilitate collaborative and reproducible research in order to lower the barriers in communication, analysis, and sharing of data, knowledge and methods. As an expert in bioinformatics, Dr. McFerrin applies mathematical and computational principles to understand large-scale biological data. Her background in such disciplines as computer science, mathematics, statistics and biology enables her to analyze data from genome sequences and clinical records to uncover novel, meaningful insights from datasets otherwise too complex to examine manually. Dr. McFerrin plays a key role in the development of Oncoscape, open-source software that helps scientists integrate information from molecular research in the laboratory with patient records and clinical studies. Her research includes the study of proteins that are involved in normal cell growth and metabolism but can also play a significant role in the development of cancer.</p>
