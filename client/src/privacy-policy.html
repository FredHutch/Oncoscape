<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This document describes how we may collect information from you or about you, why we collect this information, and how we may use or disclose this information. In addition, this document sets forth our general policies on information security.</p>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>

<p>There are several kinds of information we collect. For all visitors to the Site, we collect and log your IP address. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. We collect IP address information to better administer our system and to gather aggregate information on visitors to our site, on how our site is being used, and on the pages visitors are viewing. This aggregate information may be shared with other organizations. To maintain your anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. We may use IP address information, however, to personally identify you in order to enforce our legal rights or when required to do so by law enforcement authorities.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>We may also place small data files, called "cookies," in the browser file of your computer's hard drive. These cookies automatically identify your browser to our server when you interact with the Site. Most browsers automatically accept these cookies. We may use cookies to determine whether you are logged in to the Site, and to temporarily store application data.  We and our trusted third parties may also use cookies to serve advertisements to you after you leave the Site. Most internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but provide an option for blocking the acceptance of cookies. If you block cookies, you may not be able to use certain features or functions of the Site, or the Site may not operate in an optimal mode.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Advertising Partners</h2>

<p>We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet.</p>

<p>These advertising service providers may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interactions with specific pages. Such non-personally identifiable information does not include your name, address, email address or other personal information. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites. </p>

<p>If you prefer that we do not collect non-personally identifiable information about your website visits for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may opt out.</p>

<p>If you would like more information about this practice and your choices for not having this information used by third-party service providers, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>

<h2>Personal Health Information</h2>

<p>We may collect personal health information that you choose to share with us in the risk-assessment and disease management portions of the Site. This information may include e-mail addresses and your answers to health questions. This information will only be collected with your permission.</p>

<h2>Surveys</h2>

<p>At times, you may be asked to complete survey questions that appear on the Site. If you agree to participate in the survey, you will be asked to review and accept certain additional terms and conditions relating to use of the information you furnish, which may include personally identifiable information. Any survey terms and conditions are in addition to the Privacy Policies set forth in this Agreement.</p>

<h2>E-mail Communications, Newsletters and Related Sites</h2>

<p>The Site provides you with the opportunity to receive communications from us or third parties. Once you have decided to receive such communications, you may later decide to stop receiving them.

Please be aware that e-mail communications may not be secure and may be susceptible to interception by third parties.</p>

<h2>Information for Online Transactions</h2>

<p>Some areas of the Site may allow you to make online donations or other transactions. In connection with such transactions, we collect data necessary to complete the transaction and other information that is furnished by you. This information may be furnished to a third party in order to facilitate the transaction.</p>

<h2>Aggregate Information</h2>

<p>We use general traffic, site usage, and length of stay information for statistical reporting and may share such reports with organizations with which we have a business relationship. This aggregate information does not personally identify you.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>The Site is intended for adults aged 18 and older. It is not intended for or directed at persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you may not register or submit personally identifiable information to or through the Site. Fred Hutch does not collect personally identifiable information through the Site from any person the Hutch actually knows to be under the age of 18.</p>

<h2>Other Sites</h2>

<p>Our privacy policies apply only to your use of the Site. The Site contains links to third party sites, including sites that may indicate a special relationship with us. While we do not disclose personably identifiable information to the parties operating linked sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. You should read the privacy policies of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be collecting about you.</p>
